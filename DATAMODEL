Overview
========

The default data model for OAuthCI makes a few assumptions about what
information is linked directly to the OAuth layer, and tries to stay
as simple as possible without losing important data.

For clarity, the model uses "server" in place of provider, and
"client" in place of consumer.


Assumptions
===========

Client applications are registered independently of this framework,
but are tied to existing user accounts.

OAuth tokens are used in both server and client contexts, such that
an application can act in either role, requiring two token tables.


Server Model
============

Clients - Client applications that have registered and received a
consumer key and secret pair

  id
  key
  secret
  name              Display name of client application
  uri               URI of client application's homepage
  callback_uri      URI of client's OAuth authorization page
  user_id           User that registered the application

Server Tokens - Tokens generated for use by client applications

  id
  key
  secret
  verifier
  type
  authorized
  timestamp
  ttl
  callback_uri      URI of client's OAuth authorization page
  client_key
  user_id           User whose data is being requested

Nonces - Nonces generated for tokens

  client_key
  token_key
  timestamp
  nonce
