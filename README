OAuthCI

About
=====

This project provides a CodeIgniter library for OAuth authentication and data
exchange, designed for use by server and client roles.  It is based on the
OAuth reference implementation by Andy Smith available from the Google Code
project "oauth" [1].


Limitations
===========

Currently, the library only supports PLAINTEXT and HMAC-SHA1 signature methods,
with eventual plans for supporting RSA-SHA1 at some point in the future.


Bug Reports
===========

If you find any problems with this project, please do not hesitate to visit my
bugtracker at http://leetcode.net/mantis/ and submit a report.
